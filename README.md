# Installation script for web development environment on Ubuntu 14.04

When I do fresh installation of Ubuntu OS, I always had to install all development environment from the scratch.

I had to install Java Runtime, PHP, Node.js and PostgreSQL and MySQL etc.

It was always time consuming and took time from me.

So I have written the script for the installtion of environment.

The script will install Java Runtime environment, PHP 5.6, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Nginx, Git and Python environment such as Pip and virtualenv.
